-- 解答
select t.person_name from
    (select *, sum(weight) over(order by turn) sum_weight from queue) t
where t.sum_weight =
    (select max(t.sum_weight) from
        (select *, sum(weight) over(order by turn) sum_weight from queue) t
    where t.sum_weight <= 1000);
-- 答案
-- 方法一：自连接
SELECT a.person_name
FROM Queue a, Queue b
WHERE a.turn >= b.turn
GROUP BY a.person_id HAVING SUM(b.weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY a.turn DESC
LIMIT 1
-- 方法二：自定义变量
SELECT a.person_name
FROM (
	SELECT person_name, @pre := @pre + weight AS weight
	FROM Queue, (SELECT @pre := 0) tmp
	ORDER BY turn
) a
WHERE a.weight <= 1000
ORDER BY a.weight DESC
LIMIT 1
